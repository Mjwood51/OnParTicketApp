Run the app from the url link below. If you run from visual studio, it will throw an 
error because your computer's IP address is not added to our azure database firewall
permissions. The only downside is that the logos on the home page and the 'about us' 
sections do not appear. If you wish to run the application from visual studio to see
full features, send me an email with your computer's IP address and I can add it to 
the firewall permissions. I'm sure you probably rather use this link instead.  
Thank you for the great times this semester!

Here are the lists of users and their passwords for testing:

P.S. The app may run a bit slower through the link, you may need to wait more than a 
few seconds for some pages.
